# 🧠 Brain-Controlled Commands(BCI): Decoding Motor Intentions from  Electroencephalogram (EEG) Using ML

This project aims to decode human motor intentions (e.g., left or right hand movement) using EEG brain signals and machine learning techniques. It simulates a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system that can interpret imagined commands from raw EEG data.

## 📊 Dataset
- [EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset – PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/content/eegmmidb/1.0.0/)

## 🧪 ML Approach
- Signal Processing with MNE
- Feature Extraction (e.g., frequency bands)
- Classification (e.g., Random Forest, SVM)

## 📁 Project Structure

## 🚀 Goal
Build a system to classify imagined left/right hand movement from EEG signals.

Stay tuned!
